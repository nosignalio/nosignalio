I'm a Site Reliability Engineer based in London, UK. After spending most of my
career in telecoms, I find myself working in the fintech space, which brings
with it a different set of challenges for both the development and the operational
management of the platforms I am responsible for.

Common stack these days includes:

* AWS
* Kubernetes
* Prometheus
* Go
* Linux

Outside of the office, I'm getting into photography and enjoy drinking in
the history of London and the rest of the UK, as well as travel throughout
Europe.
