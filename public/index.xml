      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Site Reliability Engineer based in London, UK. After spending most of my career in telecoms, I find myself working in the fintech space, which brings with it a different set of challenges for both the development and the operational management of the platforms I am responsible for.
Common stack these days includes:
 AWS Kubernetes Prometheus Go Linux  Outside of the office, I&amp;rsquo;m getting into photography and enjoy drinking in the history of London and the rest of the UK, as well as travel throughout Europe.</description>
