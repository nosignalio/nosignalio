      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a story about how macOS is suddenly horrible or how Linux makes for a terrible desktop environment. This is a story about a guy who spent a ton of cash on a gaming PC&amp;hellip;and then realised that gaming is largely a pointless waste of time. Unless there&amp;rsquo;s an awesome new release. Or he goes into a bi-annual cycle of madness and decides to replay Fallout 4 with a hundred mods in pursuit of the playthrough to end all playthroughs.</description>

      <description>Confession: I struggle with AWS services, in that I don&amp;rsquo;t find them that intuitive to use, and mostly default to bouncing around trying to figure out which switches and dials to tweak in order to derive a desirable result.
That said, the complexity results in the ability to build some powerful services pretty darn quickly when compared with attempting to orchestrate similar solutions on your own.
My most recent foray into AWS (outside of the office) was getting this site running.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Site Reliability Engineer based in London, UK. After spending most of my career in telecoms, I find myself working in the fintech space, which brings with it a different set of challenges for both the development and the operational management of the platforms I am responsible for.
Common stack these days includes:
 AWS Kubernetes Prometheus Go Linux  Outside of the office, I&amp;rsquo;m getting into photography and enjoy drinking in the history of London and the rest of the UK, as well as travel throughout Europe.</description>
